## About me
I'm Morteza Mohiuddin, a frontend developer specializing in building scalable and maintainable UIs using vanilla JavaScript, modern JS frameworks, and, of course, HTML and CSS.

I have a broad understanding of software engineering principles and enjoy working in focused environments where I can think, code, and solve problems. I'm driven by building and improving systems to help achieve meaningful goals.
